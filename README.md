# -Declaration
This is to inform you that we have segregated our code into two folders. As it was our first assignment on DL we want to develop the neural network on our own. That's why there is some difference in implementation. We have actively discussed issues we faced during the process and also done analysis as a team to visualize results in wandb. Please find the links to verify changes

***Please note, In case you find it cumbersome to verify two codes, please select any one of them.We almost got some kind of result, Just the implementation style is different.***
