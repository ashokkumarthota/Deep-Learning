This is to inform that we have segregated our code into two folders.As it was our first assignment on DL we want to develop the neural network by our own.That's why there is some difference in implementation.We have actively discussed issues we faced during the process and also done analysis as team to visualise results in wandb.Please find the links to verify changes
